# Atom/Chlorine Setup

The files here represent my current [Atom](https://atom.io/) configuration for use with [Chlorine](https://atom.io/packages/chlorine).

* `init.coffee` primarily contains REBL-specific commands to inspect Vars and namespaces,
* `keymap.cson` is my cross-platform key mappings for Chlorine and those REBL commands.
